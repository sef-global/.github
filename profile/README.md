The [Sustainable Education Foundation - SEF](https://sefglobal.org/) is a platform launched with the objective of building a connector. To bring Sri Lankan Subject Matter Experts in academics and industry to build a more sustainable education ecosystem in Sri Lanka. 

We believe this would provide one of the platforms to move away from the notion of "brain Drain" to "Brain Gain"

In order to achieve such objectives, we have developed several programs such as ScholarX, International Research Council (IRC) and One Live.
